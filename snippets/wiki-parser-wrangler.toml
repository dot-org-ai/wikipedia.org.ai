# DEPRECATED: Wiki parser snippet
# This snippet has been replaced by src/workers/api/handlers/wiki.ts
# The main worker now handles wiki.org.ai traffic with 50ms+ CPU limit.
# The snippet's 5ms CPU limit caused Error 1102 on large articles like Tokyo.
# See: wikipedia-es7
#
# Keeping this file for reference - do not redeploy with routes enabled.
