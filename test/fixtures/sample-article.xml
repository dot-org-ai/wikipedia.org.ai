'''Albert Einstein''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|aɪ|n|s|t|aɪ|n}} {{respell|EYEN|styne}}; German: [ˈalbɛʁt ˈʔaɪnʃtaɪn]; 14 March 1879 – 18 April 1955) was a German-born theoretical [[physicist]] who is widely held to be one of the greatest and most influential scientists of all time.

Einstein is best known for developing the [[theory of relativity]], but he also made important contributions to the development of the theory of [[quantum mechanics]]. Relativity and quantum mechanics are the two pillars of [[modern physics]]. His mass–energy equivalence formula ''E'' = ''mc''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, which arises from relativity theory, has been dubbed "the world's most famous equation".

== Early life ==
Einstein was born in [[Ulm]], in the [[Kingdom of Württemberg]] in the [[German Empire]], on 14 March 1879. His parents were [[Hermann Einstein]], a salesman and engineer, and Pauline Koch.

== Career ==
Einstein received the 1921 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] "for his services to Theoretical Physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the [[photoelectric effect]]".

Tokyo is the political and economic center of the country, as well as the seat of the [[Emperor of Japan]] and the national government. The [[Greater Tokyo Area]] is the most populous metropolitan area in the world.

== History ==
The area that is now Tokyo was inhabited by several tribes. In 1603, [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]] established the [[Tokugawa shogunate]] and made Edo (later Tokyo) its capital.
